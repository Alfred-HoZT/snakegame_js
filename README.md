# snakegame_js
A first step into JS. 99% of code came from FreeCodeCamp. Link is at https://youtu.be/uyhzCBEGaBY?si=3vTF4SrEXa4VdpQ5 

Features not in video, suggested by YouTube user @DmitriyKochkarev:
1. Preventing food from spawning in snake body
2. Preventing snake from reversing on itself. (ie. if moving to the right, pressing the left key will have no outcome).
